# Sup :v:

I am a student of the Computer Engineering course at the University of Cape Verde. I also study artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, specializing in the areas of **Natural Language Processing** and **Automatic Speech Recognition**.

### Skills:

- **Programming Languages**
  - Python,
  - C/C++,
  - JavaScript / TypeScript,
  - etc.
 
- **Machine Learning and Deep Learning frameworks**
  
  - PyTorch,
  - Tensorflow / Keras,
  - Sklearn / Scipy,
  - Numpy,
  - Pandas,
  - NLTK,
  - Spacy,
  - etc.

### Objectives:

I like to use creative solutions to problems, and I believe Artificial Intelligence can help to solve and improve the way we handle different types of problems. So, I want to bring some of the Artificial Intelligence techniques as a solution to problems that it is really applicable to, of course being aware of the "risk" of using these types of approaches in the real world.

### How to reach me:

The better way to reach me is using my email or LinkedIn account listed below my Github profile image. Please note that since I am a college student, I can be a little busy, so I will only respond to a message in more or less time, depending on the relevance of the message.
