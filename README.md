# Sup :v:

I am a student of the Computer and Informatics Engineering course at UniCV looking for learning and applicating techniques related to Software Engineering and/or Artificial Intelligence. I am in a constant learning process and my projects are created depending of what I am studying or the ideas I had.


### :star2: Objectives

I like to use creative solutions to problems, and I believe Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence can help to solve and improve the way we handle different types of problems. So, I want to bring some of the techniques I learned as a solution to problems were are facing nowadays, of course being aware of the risk of using these types of approaches in the real world.
