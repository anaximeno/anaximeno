# Sup :v:

I am a student of the Computer and Informatics Engineering course at the University of Cape Verde and an Artificial Intelligence enthusiast.

### :star2: Objectives

I like to use creative solutions to problems, and I believe Artificial Intelligence can help to solve and improve the way we handle different types of problems. So, I want to bring some of the Artificial Intelligence techniques as a solution to problems that it is applicable to, of course being aware of the risk of using these types of approaches in the real world.
