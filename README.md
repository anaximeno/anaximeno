# Sup :v:

I study the Computer Engineering course at the University of Cape Verde. I also study artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, specializing in the areas of **Natural Language Processing** and **Automatic Speech Recognition** in my free time.

### :star2: Objectives

I like to use creative solutions to problems, and I believe Artificial Intelligence can help to solve and improve the way we handle different types of problems. So, I want to bring some of the Artificial Intelligence techniques as a solution to problems that it is really applicable to, of course being aware of the "risk" of using these types of approaches in the real world.
