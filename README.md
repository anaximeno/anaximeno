# Sup :v:

I am a student Computer Engineering course at the University of Cape Verde. I also study artificial intelligence on my free time, focusing in **Classical Artificial Intelligence Techniques**, **Natural Language Processing** and **Automatic Speech Recognition**.

### :star2: Objectives

I like to use creative solutions to problems, and I believe Artificial Intelligence can help to solve and improve the way we handle different types of problems. So, I want to bring some of the Artificial Intelligence techniques as a solution to problems that it is applicable to, of course being aware of the risk of using these types of approaches in the real world.
