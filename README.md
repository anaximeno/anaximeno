# Sup :v:

I am a student of the Computer and Informatics Engineering course at UniCV looking for interesting stuff related to software engineering and/or Artificial Intelligence.


### :star2: Objectives

I like to use creative solutions to problems, and I believe Artificial Intelligence can help to solve and improve the way we handle different types of problems. So, I want to bring some of the Artificial Intelligence techniques as a solution to problems that it is applicable to, of course being aware of the risk of using these types of approaches in the real world.

### :eye_speech_bubble: Vision

I envision a future where we would have intelligent systems to automate some of the boring stuff we have to deal with daily and have more time to spend with things we really matter.
